# Setting Up a Development Environment
Welcome to the DevOps Archistar 100 Project. To set up a local development environment on Ubuntu Linux do the following:
First, create an account on GitHub and add your public ssh key. Have the administrator add you as a contributor to the project: 
'''
https://github.com/archistar100/archistar-project
'''

Next, you can set up your workspace with the following steps:
'''
git clone git@github.com:archistar100/archistar-project.git
'''
